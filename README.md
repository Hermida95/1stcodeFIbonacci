Fibonacci Sequence Console App

This is one of my first console applications developed in C#. The program generates a specified number of Fibonacci sequence terms, but only if the input is between 7 and 22.

Features

Uses basic control structures like while/else, if, and for loops.
Allows the user to input a number, and if it meets the condition, the corresponding Fibonacci sequence is displayed.
Simple logic, ideal for understanding the flow of loops and conditions.
How It Works

The user enters a number.
If the number is between 7 and 22, the program calculates and displays the Fibonacci sequence up to that term.
If the input is outside the range, the program notifies the user and exits.
Purpose

This project is designed to practice fundamental programming concepts, including:

Control structures (while, if, for)
Input validation
Iterative calculations
Technologies Used

Language: C#
IDE: Visual Studio
